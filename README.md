# [Get Started With Phoenix][published url]
## Instructor: [Markus MÃ¼hlberger][instructor url]


Phoenix is a web framework for the up-and-coming Elixir language. With a server-side MVC pattern, it's similar to other web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or the Python framework Django. Phoenix is a new framework though, with new ideas to make web development easier and safer.

In this course you will learn how to use the Phoenix framework and get an in-depth introduction to it's key architectual concepts. You'll build a web app right through to deployment, and along the way you'll learn about how Phoenix handles template rendering, asset compliation, database integration, Websockets, testing, and more!
